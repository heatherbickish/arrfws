            when she was just a wee one and has been fostered by a wonderful AARF volunteer since she was a bottle
            feeder. She is approximately 6 months old and ready to find her forever home. She is crate trained with
            potty training in progress. Lyka is going to be a big girl. With instruction, she will make a fantastic pet
            companion.

            affectionate and curious. He's always up for a good time. He's a true people-pleaser and will do anything to
            get a smile out of you. Coco is a ball of energy and playfulness, always ready for a game or an exciting
            walk. He's an explorer at heart and loves to sniff out new adventures. Coco hasn't had a lot of leash
            walking but seems to enjoy the ones he has had. He is friendly and social, gets along with other dogs, and
            appears to be okay with cats (although his playful nature can be scary). He'll need time and patience to
            continue what his foster has taught him in his short time with her. Coco is a sweet and lovable pooch who is
            sure to bring joy and laughter into his forever home. Because of his size, professional training is
            recommended as he is still a puppy. If you're looking for a large, fun-loving, and affectionate companion,
            Coco is the perfect fit for you!

          <p class="img-p">Hey there! My official name is Rogan, but my foster mom calls me 'bud' and 'goofball.' I
            don't care what you call me as long as you have lots of energy to play with me - especially with my growing
            ball collection in the yard. Although full of energy and a bit goofy at times, I'm a smart boy too. I've
            learned 'sit' and I am working on 'wait' around my mealtimes (it's just hard cause food is sooo yummy!) I do
            have a foster sister with whom I get along great (a 30lb pup) and I even do great when I get boarded for the
            day. I still get so excited around people, but my foster mom is working with me around my jumping habit, and
            remember - I'm a smart boy. I'm even obedience trained now! A few of my favorite things are balls, car
            rides, balls, belly rubs, balls, my human foster sibling (a 13 year old), and, oh! let's not forget balls!

            her person and loves to be pet and doted on. She enjoys looking out the windows at the birds and squirrels
            and will also watch them on the YouTube cat tv streams. She was initially very shy when she came into foster
            care but is becoming more confident as each day passes. She loves spending time with her brother Russell and
            would really love to be adopted as a pair with him. Keillor enjoys playing with her toys, especially her
            flying feather and crinkle tunnel toys and enjoys napping in the sun. She would make a great addition to the
            family promising to spoil her and treat her like the princess she is. She has never met a dog but would
            likely be okay with a very calm one and would be best in a home with kids over 8.

            gladly follow you around all day and enjoys hanging out in the same room-just not on your lap. He's okay
            with being picked up for a bit, but what he loves most is being near you, playing chase, and getting head
            rubs. His favorite spots? Sleeping on a dining chair tucked under the table or keeping watch from the
            window, observing the world outside. Loki took some time to settle into his new environment, but he's grown
            bolder every day. He's well-trained, uses the litter box perfectly, and never scratches the furniture. Super
            inquisitive, Loki wants to explore every nook and cranny-closets, cupboards, even the mantelpiece!
