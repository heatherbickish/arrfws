            when she was just a wee one and has been fostered by a wonderful AARF volunteer since she was a bottle
            feeder. She is approximately 6 months old and ready to find her forever home. She is crate trained with
            potty training in progress. Lyka is going to be a big girl. With instruction, she will make a fantastic pet
            companion.

          <p class="img-p">Meet Coco, the 9 month old fun-loving, funny, and friendly pup! This young boy is
            affectionate and curious. He's always up for a good time. He's a true people-pleaser and will do anything to
            get a smile out of you. Coco is a ball of energy and playfulness, always ready for a game or an exciting
            walk. He's an explorer at heart and loves to sniff out new adventures. Coco hasn't had a lot of leash
            walking but seems to enjoy the ones he has had. He is friendly and social, gets along with other dogs, and
            appears to be okay with cats (although his playful nature can be scary). He'll need time and patience to
            continue what his foster has taught him in his short time with her. Coco is a sweet and lovable pooch who is
            sure to bring joy and laughter into his forever home. Because of his size, professional training is
            recommended as he is still a puppy. If you're looking for a large, fun-loving, and affectionate companion,
            Coco is the perfect fit for you!

          <p class="img-p">Hey there! My official name is Rogan, but my foster mom calls me 'bud' and 'goofball.' I
            don't care what you call me as long as you have lots of energy to play with me - especially with my growing
            ball collection in the yard. Although full of energy and a bit goofy at times, I'm a smart boy too. I've
            learned 'sit' and I am working on 'wait' around my mealtimes (it's just hard cause food is sooo yummy!) I do
            have a foster sister with whom I get along great (a 30lb pup) and I even do great when I get boarded for the
            day. I still get so excited around people, but my foster mom is working with me around my jumping habit, and
            remember - I'm a smart boy. I'm even obedience trained now! A few of my favorite things are balls, car
            rides, balls, belly rubs, balls, my human foster sibling (a 13 year old), and, oh! let's not forget balls!
